		<p>The lovely ladies, Carrie Markel and Katie Boody, took me under their wing for a summer. I got to learn about social media marketing and running a non-profit while I interned for them. Thanks to them and the support of others in the Startup KC community, I gained the confidence to embark on a self-directed learning journey. It was nice to experience a little taste of what freelancing, working in an office, and the stress of running a startup organization. </p>
