<h1>Past, Launchcode & Future</h1>
<article>
	<p>Before coming to Launchcode, I was attempting to start a career in marketing.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, while I had many great learning experiences and great memories, I did not gain meaningful employment.</p>

<h2>Where It All Started</h2>
<img src="images\theleanlab.jpg">
		<p>The lovely ladies, Carrie Markel and Katie Boody, took me under their wing for a summer. I got to learn about social media marketing and running a non-profit while I interned for them. Thanks to them and the support of others in the Startup KC community, I gained the confidence to embark on a self-directed learning journey. It was nice to experience a little taste of what freelancing, working in an office, and the stress of running a startup organization. </p>

<h2>Dive into Digital Marketing</h2>
<p>After gaining a great opportunity into the KC startup community, more opportunities followed as I met more friends, mentors, and interesting individuals. Each opportunity allowed me to learn a new skill set as well as how to work in a professional environment. A taste of public relations at EdgeUp Sports, customer service at Doodlekit, and startup can&#8209;do it attitude.</p>

<h2>Move to Silicon Valley</h2>

<p> After spending a year working in the KC Startup community, I had built enough confidence to pursue an alternative higher education fellowship in Silicon Valley. Through the fellowship I had access to unique events, mentor networks and a new, bold unschooling project for college students. In Silicon Valley, the sheer exposure to those who work and live there can advance your professional development and improve your overall mental well&#8209;being.</p>

<h2>Working at 2016's Hottest Tech Startup</h2>

<p>Following the "Launch" phase of my year-long fellowship, I landed an contract at Gigster. A tech Startup with an office in SOMA that has gone from seed round to Series B in one year. They were leveraging the underutilized work time of developers & engineers at the world's best companies to help underserved companies meet their technical goals. Through a proprietary AI program, they can quote, pre-stage a project, and build a team in a matter of 5 minutes. Andreessen Horowitz invested in this company based off Marc Andreesen's famous prediction that software will soon eat software.</p>

<h2>A Stop in Chicago</h2>

<p>After spending 3 months in Silicon Valley, I moved to Chicago to help a friend grow several of his small businesses. There I managed a small marketing business, bookkeeping service, and helped him reestablish his pop-up dinner club, Clandestino Dining. After the summer had passed though, we had to go our separate ways due to personal differences.</p>

<h2>Back to KC and LaunchCode</h2>
<img src="images\KCBoulevard.jpg">
<p> My experiences over the last three years exposed me to the exponentially growing utility of knowing how to code. Every job I had been working could easily be automated depending on our current tech level and the time required to develop the necessary software and hardware. I developed the strong belief that in order to be relevant, everyone will eventually be required to know how to interact with computers in their everyday life. When I returned to KC, desperate for employment and without a clue where to look, my father (a senior data programmer for Kelly Automotive) suggested LaunchCode.</p>

<h2>LaunchCode and my technical aspirations</h2>

<p> Since before starting LaunchCode, I've had a deep interest in data, the collection and utilization of it in business and scientific applications. After going through Unit 1, my interest evolved more deeply in using coding to program an AI that could do the same things a coder with a couple of data programs could do.</p>

<p> My hope is to eventually settle into a role as a Data Scientist/Analyst or as a Project Manager.</p>

<h2>A couple worthy notes</h2>
<p>Since starting LaunchCode, I have found a lot more opportunities to work on projects with my engineering friends. One project is a DIY Amazon Alexa using a the open-source project Jasper.</p>
